1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,000
We make decisions all the time.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,200
And guess what?

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,200
Most of them are tied to

4
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,900
where something happens.

5
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,200
Some choices are simple and short lived.

6
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,200
Like deciding

7
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,800
where should I grab lunch today? Sure.

8
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,200
It seems trivial

9
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,800
unless you bump into your all time

10
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,500
favorite actor during your meal.

11
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,400
In that case,

12
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,500
your decision about lunch

13
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,400
could become a story

14
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,700
you tell for the rest of your life.

15
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:22,800
Other decisions,

16
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,800
like figuring out

17
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,800
what's the most energy

18
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,700
efficient route from home to campus,

19
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,700
might have broader implications.

20
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,800
They might reduce your carbon footprint,

21
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,900
save you money,

22
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,200
or even inspire others

23
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,600
to make more environmentally

24
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,300
conscious choices.

25
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,900
Let's dive into the world of spatial

26
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,900
thinking and reasoning to level up

27
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,900
your decision making skills.

28
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,600
Since you are already making location

29
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,300
based decisions daily,

30
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,000
why not learn

31
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,500
how to make them more efficient,

32
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,500
informed, and dare we say, fun?

33
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,700
So what is spatial thinking anyway?

34
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,200
Spatial thinking helps us

35
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,600
see and understand the world

36
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,700
in ways that aren't always obvious.

37
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,700
It is a collection of cognitive skills

38
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,200
that enable us to understand space,

39
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,900
as in how objects relate to each other

40
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,300
in the physical world,

41
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,900
express relationships

42
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:08,800
like recognizing

43
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,100
how a river winds through landscape,

44
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,600
and reason spatially,

45
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,500
which is making sense

46
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,100
of patterns, distributions,

47
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,100
and connections in space.

48
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,000
Remember those shape

49
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,300
sorting toys with blocks

50
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,600
and matching holes?

51
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,800
That was your first lesson

52
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,400
in dimensions., continuity, proximity,

53
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,400
and separation.

54
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,200
Fast forward to

55
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,000
today, and those same spatial

56
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,300
thinking skills are at work.

57
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,800
when you plan a hiking route through

58
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,800
winding trails

59
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,600
or evaluate

60
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,600
the layout of your neighborhood.

61
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,800
Maps are like cheat sheets

62
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,100
for spatial reasoning.

63
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,900
They take abstract ideas

64
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,700
like road density or population clusters

65
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:43,900
and turn them into something

66
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:44,800
we can see,

67
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,800
analyze, and understand at a glance.

68
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:51,000
By using maps, we can identify patterns,

69
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,400
asking why some areas have dense networks

70
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,300
while others are more remote,

71
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,900
understand relationships,

72
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,200
such as how road densities

73
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,000
affect traffic,

74
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,300
pollution, or access to services,

75
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,100
and communicate effectively,

76
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,200
as a map can explain

77
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,200
complex ideas

78
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,600
with no lengthy paragraphs required.

79
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,100
Whether it's urban planning,

80
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,900
environmental conservation,

81
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,700
or figuring out where to park,

82
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,000
spatial reasoning helps us

83
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,700
weigh options

84
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,800
and make choices that matter.

85
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,300
And here's the fun part.

86
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,600
Learning to think spatially

87
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,000
is like adding a turbo boost

88
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,900
to your decision making skills.

89
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,800
So, are you ready to think spatially?

90
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,200
Let's unlock your inner map

91
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,600
maker and problem solver

92
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,600
because the world is full of patterns

93
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,800
waiting to be discovered.
