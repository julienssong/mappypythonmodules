00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
We make decisions all the time—

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.000
and guess what? 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Most of them are tied to where something happens.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Some choices are simple and short-lived, like deciding,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
“Where should I grab lunch today?”

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Sure, it seems trivial—

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
unless you bump into your all-time 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
favorite actor during your meal. 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
In that case, your decision about lunch could 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
become a story you tell for the rest of your life!

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Other decisions, like figuring out 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
“What’s the most energy-efficient route from home to campus?” 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
might have have broader implications. 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
They might reduce your carbon footprint, 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
save you money, or even inspire others to

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
make more environmentally conscious choices.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Let’s dive into the world of spatial thinking and reasoning 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
to level up your decision-making skills.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Since we’re already making 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
location-based decisions daily, 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
why not learn how to make them more 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
efficient, informed, and dare we say... 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000
fun? 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
So What is spatial thinking anyway?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Spatial thinking helps us see and

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
understand the world in ways that aren’t always obvious. 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
It is “a collection of cognitive skills” 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
that enable us to: understand space—

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
as in how objects relate to each other 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
in the physical world, express relationships—

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
like recognizing how a river winds through a landscape,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and reason spatially—which is 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
making sense of patterns, distributions, 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
and connections in space.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Remember those shape-sorting toys with 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
blocks and matching holes? 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
That was your first lesson in dimensions, 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
continuity, proximity, and separation.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Fast forward to today,  

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and those same spatial thinking skills are 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
at work when you plan a hiking route through 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
winding trails, or evaluate the layout 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
of your neighborhood.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Maps are like cheat sheets for spatial reasoning. 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
They take abstract ideas—

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
like road density or population clusters—

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and turn them into something we can see, 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
analyze, and understand at a glance.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
By using maps, we can:

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
identify patterns—asking why some areas 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
have dense networks while others are more remote,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
understand relationships—

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
such as how road densities affect traffic, 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
pollution, or access to services,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
and communicate effectively—

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
as a map can explain complex ideas 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
with no lengthy paragraphs required.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Whether it’s urban planning, environmental 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
conservation, or figuring out where to park, 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
spatial reasoning helps us weigh options 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
and make choices that matter.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000
And here’s the fun part: 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
learning to think spatially is like 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
adding a turbo boost to your decision-making skills. 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
So, are you ready to think spatially? 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Let’s unlock your inner map-maker

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
and problem-solver, because the world 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
is full of patterns waiting to be discovered.
