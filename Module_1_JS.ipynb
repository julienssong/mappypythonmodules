According to the [National Research Council of the National Academies](https://www.nap.edu/catalog/11019/learning-to-think-spatially), spatial thinking is “a collection of cognitive skills” that enable us to:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Understand space:** How objects relate to each other in the physical world.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Express relationships:** Like recognizing how close two cities are or how a river winds through a landscape.\n",

That was your first lesson in dimensions, continuity, proximity, and separation. (Look at you, a spatial thinker before you could even tie your shoes!)\n",

    "By using maps, we can:\n",

    "- **Identify patterns:** Why do some areas have dense networks while others are more remote?\n",
