    "\n",
    "A **composite indicator (CI)** is a mathematical aggregation of a set of individual indicators that measure multi-dimensional concepts but usually have no common units of measurement [(Nardo et al., 2005)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/composite-indicator). \n",
    "***Spatial* composite indicators** simplify complex, multi-dimensional data into concise performance metrics used in policy and decision-making. While useful for visualizing intricate systems, these indicators are inherently subjective, as their components are chosen by decision-makers [(Şalap-Ayça, 2025)](https://i-guide.io/i-guide-vco/rethinking-spatial-composite-indicators-with-the-lens-of-machine-learning/).  \n",

    "\n",
    "The **Social Vulnerability Index (SVI)** “is a place-based index designed to identify and quantify communities experiencing social vulnerability such as poverty, lack of access to transportation, and crowded housing\" [(CDC, 2024)](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/place-health/php/svi/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "The SVI “uses 16 variables to identify communities that may need support before, during, or after disasters. These variables are grouped into four major areas of social vulnerability, then combined into a single measure of overall social vulnerability” [(CDC, 2024)](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/place-health/php/svi/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "The SVI needs multiple indices because social vulnerability is a multifaceted concept encompassing various factors that influence a community's ability to cope with and recover from hazards or adverse events. By combining multiple indices, the SVI provides a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of social vulnerability, allowing for a more targeted and effective allocation of resources and interventions.\n"
